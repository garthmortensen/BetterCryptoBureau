# Elaboration Part 1 - Framework and Services

*2022.08.11, 50 pts = 12.5 %*

In Backlog, create a task, and move it as you progress.

Decide on a framework = **Spring**

Considering our user stories, list out all the services that will be needed. E.g.:

| CLASS NAME | FUNCTION                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clerk      | Persistent storage - database storage and operations.        |
| Artist     | Display of data to users (View from MVC)                     |
| Controller | Controller from MVC architectural pattern.                   |
| Bouncer    | Security - for user authentication                           |
| Calculator | Performs complex calculations - calculate cryptocurrency reputation |

Not all these, or even any, are needed. We'll probably have more. Expect the list to change.

We'll use the framework in the narrations created for our user story refinement, and can be updated as the project continues.
