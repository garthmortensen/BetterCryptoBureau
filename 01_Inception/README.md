### Vision Statement

For retail investors who need a place to research cryptocurrencies before making investments.

The Better Cryptocurrency Bureau App is a financial information service provider that helps investors find trustworthy cryptocurrencies.

Unlike Coinmarketcap.com, our product actually helps investors determine if a cryptocurrency is a scam or sound project.
